# Unclosed HTML Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple but common error in HTML: forgetting to close a tag.

The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed `<p>` (paragraph) tag.  This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior or validation errors.

The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected HTML with properly closed tags.

This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing HTML.
Unclosed tags can affect page structure, rendering and cause inconsistencies.  Proper validation is always a best practice to catch and avoid such issues.
